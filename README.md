# Stirling PDF v1 Ansible role

>[!WARNING]
> This role is in maintenance mode. While Stirling PDF itself continues to be actively developed, this role is configured to install version 1 and will not support version 2, because it enforces Open Core license since [v2.0.0](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Stirling PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

This role *implicitly* depends on:

- [`com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help)
- [`com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base)

Check [`defaults/main.yml`](defaults/main.yml) for the full list of supported options. Refer to [this page](docs/configuring-stirling-pdf.md) for details about setting up the service with this role.

💡 For an Ansible playbook which integrates this role and makes it easier to use, see the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

## Development

### pre-commit

You can optionally install a Git pre-commit hook (via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) + [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/)) that runs formatting and linting checks before each commit. See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for which hooks are to be executed.

To install the hook, run the [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) command below:

```sh
just prek-install-git-pre-commit-hook
```

### Molecule

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

Refer to [this page](./molecule/README.md) for details about how to utilize it.
